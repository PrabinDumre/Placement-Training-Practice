# Problem Statements and Solutions
This repository contains solutions to various coding problems, including:

Sum of Cubes
Calculate the sum of cubes between two integers M and N. If M is greater than N, return 0.

Railway Ticket Price Calculation
Calculate the total cost of purchasing railway tickets based on the buyer's age.

Regular price: Rs. 50
Senior citizens (age ≥ 60): Rs. 30
Children (age ≤ 12): Rs. 20
Food Order System
Simulate a food ordering system where different food items have different prices. If the order exceeds Rs. 500, apply a 10% discount.

Move Zeroes to End (Array Manipulation)
Move all zeroes to the end of an array while maintaining the order of other elements.

Move Empty Boxes to End
Rearrange an array to move all 0s (representing empty boxes) to the end while keeping the order of non-zero elements intact.

Red Pen Green Pen (Pen Switching Problem)
Calculate the number of times you need to switch from a green pen (for odd numbers) to a red pen (for even numbers) while writing numbers on a whiteboard.

Inventory Character Frequency Analysis
Analyze the frequency of characters in a string that represents an inventory list of fruits.

Run the solutions:
Use a Python interpreter (e.g., python3).
