# Problem Statements and Solutions
This repository contains solutions to various coding problems, including:

# 1. Sum of Cubes
Calculate the sum of cubes between two integers M and N. If M is greater than N, return 0.

# 2. Railway Ticket Price Calculation
Calculate the total cost of purchasing railway tickets based on the buyer's age.

Regular price: Rs. 50
Senior citizens (age ≥ 60): Rs. 30
Children (age ≤ 12): Rs. 20
Food Order System
Simulate a food ordering system where different food items have different prices. If the order exceeds Rs. 500, apply a 10% discount.

# 3. Move Zeroes to End (Array Manipulation)
Move all zeroes to the end of an array while maintaining the order of other elements.

# 4. Move Empty Boxes to End
Rearrange an array to move all 0s (representing empty boxes) to the end while keeping the order of non-zero elements intact.

# 5. Red Pen Green Pen (Pen Switching Problem)
Calculate the number of times you need to switch from a green pen (for odd numbers) to a red pen (for even numbers) while writing numbers on a whiteboard.

# 6. Inventory Character Frequency Analysis
Analyze the frequency of characters in a string that represents an inventory list of fruits.

Run the solutions:
Use a Python interpreter (e.g., python3).
